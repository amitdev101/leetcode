1. there are islands represented by 0 and 1 in binary tree. 
how to find number of islands. + now find islands of different sizes as well.

2. Find the number of cities with certain time you can visite from node A to node B with the given time T.
    you are provided the nodes and Time to reach from node a to node b. Here cities = Nodes.

3. You are given an array of V shape that it is first strictly decreasing and then increasing. 
    Your task is to find the lowest point with better complexity other than O(N)
    this was tricky as it can contain duplicate elements.
