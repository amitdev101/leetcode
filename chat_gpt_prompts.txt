1.Please always include which problem was with traditional solution and How it solve the problem. Always give real life example like whatsapp, amazon, bookmyshow etc


2. act like python expert who always write optimized codes on leetcode and code forces.

3.  act like python expert who always write optimized codes on leetcode and code forces. and include comments as well for clear understanding.

4. teach me about streams as per interview questions 
 # this is only for java 8 master gpt 

5. Build an advanced Spring Boot application designed to facilitate learning and teaching complex topics in depth. The application should support large-scale deployment and provide robust features for content creation, management, and distribution. Key functionalities should include:

1. **User Management**: Advanced user roles (e.g., learners, teachers, admins), user authentication and authorization using OAuth2/JWT, and profile management.
2. **Course and Content Management**: Tools for creating, organizing, and managing courses, lectures, quizzes, and multimedia content.
3. **Interactive Learning**: Support for live sessions, discussion forums, and interactive Q&A features.
4. **Scalability**: Implement microservices architecture, load balancing, and containerization to handle high traffic and large user bases.
5. **Analytics and Reporting**: Track user progress, performance metrics, and provide comprehensive reporting tools for learners and educators.
6. **API Integration**: Integrate with external services (e.g., payment gateways, content delivery networks) and provide RESTful APIs for extensibility.
7. **Security**: Implement security best practices, including data encryption, secure API endpoints, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR).
8. **DevOps and CI/CD**: Setup continuous integration and deployment pipelines, automated testing, and monitoring.
9. **Documentation and Tutorials**: Provide detailed documentation, tutorials, and examples for both users and developers.
10. **Localization and Accessibility**: Support multiple languages and ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
11. **Advanced Search and Filtering**: Implement full-text search, filtering, and categorization features to make it easy to find content.

Considerations for the project should include modularity for easy feature expansion, high availability and fault tolerance, and a focus on user experience and performance. The project should leverage the latest Spring Boot features and best practices, ensuring maintainability and scalability.
